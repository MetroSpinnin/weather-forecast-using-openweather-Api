## Openweather Api for weather forecasting
we are going to create a PHP application to display weather forecast information using an API. I have used OpenWeatherMap service to implement this with PHP. We will just grab the weather information provided by the API and display it in the application.

This is one of the best API service that provides weather forecast. It provides tremendous volume of weather data regularly. It is a free service with limited access. For basic usage, it should be sufficient and for advanced you may have to pay for it. Integrating this API with a PHP application is easy. The following three steps are used for the integration.

## Steps
Get API key
Locate city id
Request weather forecast by sending API key and city id
